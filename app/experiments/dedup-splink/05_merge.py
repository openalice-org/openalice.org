"""Step 5: apply the reviewed verdicts.csv to people_viz.json — fold every
non-primary record in a FUSE cluster into its suggested_primary_id and drop
the rest. REJECT/REVIEW rows are left untouched (this only acts on FUSE).

Hard veto: a FUSE cluster whose members carry 2+ DIFFERENT non-null ORCIDs
is skipped outright, regardless of verdict. ORCID is a verified personal
identifier, so that's proof of multiple distinct real people (typically the
same common-surname small research community sharing enough coauthors to
trip the jaccard threshold — Andersson, Nielsen, Hansen, Zhang, etc.), not
one person split across records. Found the hard way: 43 of the first 151
FUSE clusters merged this way turned out to have conflicting ORCIDs.

Field-merge rules (each chosen because the underlying per-record fields were
computed over a DISJOINT subset of the same real person's papers — OpenAlex
split their profile, it didn't duplicate their papers — so most stats are
correctly additive, not double-counted):

  total_papers, quantum_papers, matched_papers, total_patents,
  quantum_patents          -> summed across the cluster
  patents (array)          -> unioned, deduped by epo_id
  yearly (per-year papers/citations) -> summed per year, keyed union
  first_year / last_year   -> min / max across the cluster
  h_index, quantum_h_index,
  global_h_index           -> max across the cluster (each is itself computed
                               over a subset of the true combined corpus, so
                               the true merged h-index is >= every member's;
                               max is the conservative estimate available
                               without recomputing h-index from raw citations)
  quantum_share, x, x_raw,
  confidence               -> recomputed EXACTLY from the merged
                               quantum_papers/total_papers via the same
                               formula build_people_data.py uses (not an
                               approximation)
  y, y_raw, sensing_share,
  communication_share,
  computing_share          -> quantum_papers-weighted average across the
                               cluster (these come from NLP/embedding scoring
                               over each member's own paper subset, which
                               can't be cheaply recomputed here; a weighted
                               average over the disjoint subsets approximates
                               what re-scoring the union would give)
  name                     -> the longest name string among the cluster
                               (most complete display form, e.g. "Valéry
                               Zwiller" over "V. Zwiller")
  orcid                    -> primary's, falling back to the first non-null
                               ORCID found among the cluster
  topics, keywords,
  example_titles           -> union, primary's own entries first, deduped,
                               capped to the original list length
  institution, university,
  country, tier            -> primary's (already the majority/highest-
                               evidence value for the surviving id)
  id                       -> primary's id; a `merged_from` field records the
